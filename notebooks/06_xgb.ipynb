Deeper trees can capture more specific patterns but are very likely to overfit.\n","  *   `min_child_weight`\n","      * This sets the minimum sum of weights required in a leaf node.

Training and Optimization Hyperparameters\n","  *   `learning_rate`\n","      * This shrinkage parameter scales the contribution of each new tree. A smaller value makes the model more robust and less prone to overfitting but requires more trees (`n_estimators`) to train.\n","  *   `objective`\n","      * This defines the mathematical goal, or loss function, that the model tries to minimize.

Regularization and Stochasticity Hyperparameters\n","  *   `subsample`\n","      * This is the fraction of training data (rows) randomly sampled for building each tree.

This forces the model to find diverse patterns instead of relying on the same few strong features.\n","  *   `reg_alpha` (L1 Regularization)\n","      * This applies an L1 regularization penalty (based on absolute weight values) to the leaf weights. It encourages sparsity, potentially pushing the weights of less important features to zero.\n","  *   `reg_lambda` (L2 Regularization)\n","      * This applies an L2 regularization penalty (based on squared weight values) to the leaf weights.
